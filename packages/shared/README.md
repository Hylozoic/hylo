# @hylo/shared - Hylo code in common between Web, Mobile, and the Backend

The purpose of this library is the sharing of critical code between the Web and Mobile front-ends and the Backend. A primary focus at this time is text handling to ensure consistency of storage and presentation across the apps.

This library is used as raw ESM by both the Hylo Web and Mobile projects, and is built by the Backend project (see apps/backend/package.json "dev" and "start" scripts).
