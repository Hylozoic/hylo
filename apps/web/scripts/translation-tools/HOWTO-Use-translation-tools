There are a number of scripts in this directory to help make creating and managing translations easier. Here are some prompts in Cursor with Claude 3.5 Sonnet that work:

"Can you add a new keypair to public/locales/en.json and translate it to all languages using the tools in scripts/translation-tools? Here is the key:

'All thriving, in a symphony of life'"

Or

"There are a number of new keys in en.json. Using the tools in scripts/translation-tools/, can you translate them to all other languages?"

Or

"Using the tools in scripts/translation-tools/, make sure that each language has all of the keys found in en.json"

There are two other howtos, with instructions for anyone who wants to help translate.
